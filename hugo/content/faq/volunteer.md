We welcome your contributions!
In fact, since the Anthology is run entirely on volunteer energy, we need them.
The best way to contribute is to browse our [Github issues](https://twitter.com/TheGarlandSitIn/status/1123628614342385666) page, and see what needs to be done that might overlap with your interests or skills.
Please also feel free to email the director, anthology@aclweb.org.
You might also be interested in our [call for volunteers]({{< relref "/info/volunteer.md" >}}).
